  "readme": "# xlsx\n\nCurrently a parser for XLSX files.  Cleanroom implementation from the ISO 29500  Office Open XML specifications.\n\nThis has been tested on some very basic XLSX files generated from Excel 2011.\n\n*THIS WAS WHIPPED UP VERY QUICKLY TO SATISFY A VERY SPECIFIC NEED*.  If you need something that is not currently supported, file an issue and attach a sample file.  I will get to it :)\n\n## Installation\n\nIn node:\n\n    npm install xlsx\n\nIn the browser:\n\n    <script lang=\"javascript\" src=\"/path/to/jszip.js\"></script>\n    <script lang=\"javascript\" src=\"/path/to/xlsx.js\"></script>\n\n## Usage\n\nSee `xlsx2csv.njs` in the bin directory for usage in node.\n\nSee http://niggler.github.com/js-xlsx/ for a browser example.\n\n## Notes \n\n`.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook\n\n`.Sheets[sheetname]` returns a data structure representing the sheet.  Each key\nthat does not start with `!` corresponds to a cell (using `A-1` notation).  \n\n`.Sheets[sheetname][address].v` returns the value of the cell and `.Sheets[sheetname][address].t` returns the type of the cell (constrained to the enumeration `ST_CellType` as documented in page 4215 of ISO/IEC 29500-1:2012(E) ) \n\nSimple usage:\n\n    var XLSX = require('xlsx')\n    var xlsx = XLSX.readFile('test.xlsx');\n    var sheet_name_list = xlsx.SheetNames;\n    xlsx.SheetNames.forEach(function(y) {\n      for (z in zip.Sheets[y]) {\n        if(z[0] === '!') continue;\n        console.log(y + \"!\" + z + \"=\" + JSON.stringify(zip.Sheets[y][z].v));\n      }\n    });\n\n## License\n\nPlease consult the attached LICENSE file for details.
